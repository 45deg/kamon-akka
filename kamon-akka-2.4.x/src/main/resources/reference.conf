    # pattern fails with a `AskTimeoutException` and the log message will contain information depending of the strategy selected.
    # strategies:
    #   - off: nothing to do.
    #   - lightweight: logs the warning when a timeout is reached using org.aspectj.lang.reflect.SourceLocation.

    # Filter names from which actor groups will be created. Setting up actor groups require two steps: first, define
    # a filter under the kamon.util.filters key and second, add that filter to this key. E.g.: for the following config:
    #
    # kamon.util.filters {
    #   worker-actors {
    #     includes = ["my-system/user/application/worker-*", "my-system/user/workers/**"]
    #     excludes = [ ]
    #   }
    # }
    #
    # kamon.akka {
    #   actor-groups = [ "worker-actors" ]
    # }
    #
    # An actor group named "worker-actors" will be created and include all the actors whose path matches the provided
    # patterns.
    actor-groups = [ ]
